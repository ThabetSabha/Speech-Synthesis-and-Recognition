# Speech-Synthesis-and-Recognition



A simple website created using JS, CSS, and HTML.    
    
The website uses two Web-APIs :    
1- SpeechSynthesis    
2- SpeechRecognition.     
     
The user can then either use the SpeechSynthesis API to read some text, or use the SpeechRecognition API to generate text by talking.     
    
*The SpeechRecognition Web API isn't yet supported outside of chromium based browsers.    
*Files need to be hosted using a server (eg: live-server) to use the SpeechRecognition API.     
     
*most of the code was reused from my JS30 previous projects :
